# Lumiere

Lumiere is a 2D Dungeon Crawler game where the player spawns in a randomly generated dungeon and has to fight monsters and collect items to survive. As the player progresses through the game and clears dungeons, the game will become increasingly difficult. 

The goal of this project is to create a game that is intuitively modular, scalable and extensible so that designers and developers can easily add more features to it.
